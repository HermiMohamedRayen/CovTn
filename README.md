<h1>CovTn</h1>

CovTn is a car-pooling web and Android application developed using Angular, Spring Boot, and native Android (Kotlin).
It aims to help reduce transportation issues—<i>if car-pooling were legally permitted in my country.</i>

This project was developed under tight deadlines as a university mini-project.
I plan to enhance and optimize it further when I have more time.

This application is secured by two-factor authentication (2FA) with a mechanism
which ensures that the last request device only will have the token (JWT)
